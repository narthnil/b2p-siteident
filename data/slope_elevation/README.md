# Extracting slope and elevation data from Google Earth Engine

## Signing up for Google Earth Engine

In order to extract the data, you must be registered to Google Earth Engine
with a Google account. Go to
[earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com/) to sign-in.
Approval usually takes several hours to a day.

The data structure in this folder is as follows after following the js scripts
to extract data:

```
data/slope_elevation/
├── elevation_rwanda.tif
├── elevation_rwanda_uganda.js
├── elevation_uganda.tif
├── README.md
├── slope_rwanda.tif
├── slope_rwanda_uganda.js
└── slope_uganda.tif
```

## Using Google Earth Engine Code editor to extract slope and elevation

The scripts `data/slope_elevation/elevation_rwanda_uganda.js` and
`data/slope_elevation/elevation_rwanda_uganda.js` to extract elevation and
slope. These scripts are specifically written to extract data for Rwanda and
Uganda. However, by changing `Uganda` (lines 12)

```
var roi = countries.filterMetadata('country_na', 'equals', 'Uganda');
```

to any other country, this script can be used to extract data of any other
country.
The script extract elevation / slope of a specific country. The script
normalizes the elevation values ($\min=0, \max=9000$) to values in range of
[0, 255]. Similarly, the script normalizes the slope values
($\min=0, \max=90$) to values in range of [0, 255].
