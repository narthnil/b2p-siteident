# Extracting OSM map images

This extraction is done with QGIS. Please download QGIS at the
[official page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

## Add XYZ tile server based layer
Go to `Layer -> Add Layer -> Add XYZ Layer...` and create a new layer for the
wmflabs OSM without labels under the connection url:

```
https://tiles.wmflabs.org/osm-no-labels/${z}/${x}/${y}.png	
```

taken from 
[OSM tile servers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers).

For that click on `New`, add a `Name` and the URL from above.

In order to see this map, drag the map from the `Browser` panel (if you don't see the browser panel, then click `View -> Panels -> Browser`) to the `Layers` panel.

## Projection

Set the projection to `EPSG:4326`. The projection is shown in the bottom right next to the option `Render`.
