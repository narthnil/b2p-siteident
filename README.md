## Install gdal

[Gdal](https://gdal.org/) is a great tool for fast manipulation of rasters. However, it can be tricky to install. The best option it to install with Homebrew (in the current conda environment):

```
brew install gdal
```

Currently gdal is being used to rasterize vector data, using `gdal_rasterize` from the command line. Example:
```
gdal_rasterize data/osm/rwanda/roads/gis_osm_roads_free_1_with_tag_value.shp data/osm/rwanda/roads/gis_osm_roads_free_1_with_tag_value.tif -tr 0.0005 0.0005 -a fclass_val
```
The documentation on this service is found [here](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_rasterize.html).

## Model training

```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --master_addr="127.0.0.2" --master_port=8798 --nproc_per_node=4 train.py

```
